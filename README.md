# Quantitative-Volatility-Trading-Strategy

This project details an intraday quantitative trading strategy that uses a GARCH model to forecast daily volatility and combines it with intraday technical indicators to generate trading signals. The strategy is backtested on over two years of simulated 5-minute financial data.

## Strategy Overview

The core of this strategy is a contrarian approach to volatility. It operates in two main stages:

1.  **Daily Macro Signal Generation:** A GARCH(1,3) model is fitted on a 180-day rolling basis using historical daily price data to forecast the next day's volatility. A custom "prediction premium" is then calculated, which measures the deviation between the forecasted volatility and the recent realized variance. A significant deviation generates a macro-level trading signal for the day.

2.  **Intraday Trade Entry:** The daily macro signal is combined with intraday technical indicators (RSI and Bollinger Bands®) on 5-minute data. A trade is triggered only when both the daily and intraday signals align, indicating a potential over-extension in the market. Positions are entered and held until the end of the trading day.

## Technologies & Libraries Used

* **Python**
* **pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
* **NumPy:** For numerical calculations.
* **Arch:** For GARCH model implementation and volatility forecasting.
* **pandas-ta:** For calculating RSI and Bollinger Bands®.
* **Matplotlib:** For visualizing the backtest results.

## How to Run

1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed. You can install the required libraries using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy arch pandas-ta matplotlib
    ```

2.  **Data:** Place the `simulated_daily_data.csv` and `simulated_5min_data.csv` files in the same directory as the script.

3.  **Execution:** Run the Jupyter Notebook `script.ipynb` to perform the backtest and generate the performance plot.

## Backtest Results

The strategy was backtested on 5-minute data spanning from late 2021 to late 2023. The cumulative return of the strategy is visualized in the final plot generated by the notebook.
